# Major Components of Linux Kernel Process Management

1. **Process Control Block (PCB)**
   - Stores all information about a process (state, CPU registers, memory limits, open files, scheduling info)

2. **Process Scheduler**
   - Decides which process to run next, allocating CPU time based on priority and scheduling algorithms

3. **Context Switching**
   - Saves state of a running process and restores another when switching, enabling smooth multitasking

4. **Process Creation and Termination**
   - Handles creation of new processes (fork(), exec()) and manages their termination, including resource cleanup

5. **Inter-Process Communication (IPC)**
   - Provides mechanisms for processes to communicate and share data (pipes, message queues, shared memory, sockets)

6. **Memory Management Unit (MMU) interaction**
   - Works with MMU to manage virtual memory, including page tables and memory protection for each process

7. **Process State Management**
   - Tracks and updates the state of each process (running, ready, waiting, terminated) throughout its lifecycle

8. **Process Synchronization**
   - Implements mechanisms like semaphores and mutexes to coordinate access to shared resources

9. **Signal Handling**
   - Manages sending, receiving, and processing of signals for inter-process communication and process control

10. **Thread Management**
    - Supports creation, scheduling, and management of threads within processes for efficient parallel execution
