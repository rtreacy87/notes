# Basic Components of the Linux Kernel

1. **Process Management**
   - Handles process lifecycle (creation, termination, administration)
   - Manages process states and process control blocks (PCBs)
   - Includes the Process Scheduler, which allocates CPU time to processes

2. **Memory Management**
   - Handles memory allocation and deallocation
   - Manages virtual memory and paging
   - Implements memory protection

3. **File System Management**
   - Implements the Virtual File System (VFS) interface
   - Supports various file systems (ext4, btrfs, etc.)
   - Manages file and directory operations

4. **Device Drivers**
   - Provide interfaces between hardware and the kernel
   - Handle device-specific operations and interrupts

5. **Networking Stack**
   - Implements network protocols (TCP/IP, etc.)
   - Manages network interfaces and routing

6. **Inter-Process Communication (IPC)**
   - Provides mechanisms for processes to exchange data and synchronize
   - Implements pipes, sockets, message queues, etc.

7. **System Call Interface**
   - Provides APIs for user-space programs to request kernel services
   - Acts as a bridge between user space and kernel space

8. **Architecture-specific Code**
   - Manages hardware-specific operations for different CPU architectures
   - Handles low-level system initialization and hardware abstraction

9. **Security Module**
   - Implements access control and security policies
   - Includes features like SELinux and AppArmor
